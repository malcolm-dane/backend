Updated the sample parse server heroku to work flawlessly on Heroku like back in the day. This still needs some cleaning, but I have several apps built on a variant of this. I'll add some documentation and a wiki on how to easily deploy. This has everything working, and is serving custom routes,webhooks, and cloud codes. If you need a REST backend fast for rapid deployment and your organization uses salesforce this will work for rapid prototyping.
